        <p> 
          The past couple years of all our lives have not been the best. 
          COVID-19 pandemic spread havoc, increasing human suffering,
          destabilizing the global economy and upending the lives of
          billions of people around the globe. The importance of health and well being and its 
          larger impact on the global machinery and day to day life of people became clearer 
          to everyone through this troubling times.
          <br>
          <br>
          Road accidents are responsible for 1.3 million deaths and 
          50 million injuries annually all over the world. Road  crashes are also the leading killer 
          of children and young people worldwide, aged five to 29. 
          The Covid 19 pandemic killed about 6 million people in about 2 years. 
          The reason we were able to get some control over the disease was through diligent 
          efforts of scientists and doctors to better understand the disease and through this 
          gained knowledge we were able to defeat the pandemic. The same needs to happen with global road safety. 
          The pain of the families loosing their loved ones is excruciating and we need to put in efforts to better 
          understand global road safety to make sure everyone's loved ones return safely home from their respective journeys.
          
          This was our drive to work on this project as we all feel that this is the most pointless way to dies. 
          <p style="color:green";>  Also we would like to mention that this project addresses the Sustainable Development Goal 3, regarding "Good Health and Well-being"
            <img   src="images/sdg3.png" width="40" height="40"> more specifically target 3.6: Reduce road injuries and deaths.  </p> 
        
          As things stand, they are set to cause a further estimated 13 million deaths and 500 million injuries during the next decade according to UN. 
          Road accidents are entirely preventable, and our priority is to investigate causes so that preventive measures can be implemented.
          
          There are also other countless disadvantages of car collisions 
          (e.g. disrupt traffic flow, cost resources, wastes fuel ,loss of life). 
          Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public 
          are fatal traffic collisions. So there is huge potential in building a traffic safety model that can help 
          detect reasons of collisions early and help implement systemic measure to prevent these unfortunate events.

This website aim at empowering you to investigate the Motor Vehicle Collisions in NewYork city for instance when, where and the factors
contributing to the accedent in order to gain more edcuation and knowladege on minmizing the the number of accedents and eventually the number of died people.

            <h3>The goal of analyzing the data of Motor Vehicle Collisions</h3>
            <p>
            The goal for the end user's experience in this analysis is if first of all to give an
            understanding of the data in depth. Most people would have several expectations and 
            assumptions for these patterns, like the most accident prone hours, night-driving, 
            bad weather conditions, driver negligence  etc. Therefore we want to provide a detailed 
            overview of how the data is distributed along different time perspectives. 
            <br>
            <br>

            In particular, we want to show how the distributions have changed over the years, 
            especially contrasting it with Covid-19 year(2020) as this may provide meaningful insights as 
            the road activity was significantly decreased in 2020. This could provide insights 
            the accidents from an population density perspective, where many hope to see more accidents 
            per capita in more crowded regions.
            <br>
            <br>

            Moreover, we also want to show to what extent we can predict the accidents, 
            their number, how many people die, where does the next accident happen and 
            the most relevant causes for the accident. And finally, we want to give the user a
            understanding of how the weather impacts these patterns, as a interesting perspective on the subject.
