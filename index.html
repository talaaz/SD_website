          The past couple of years of our lives has not been the best. COVID-19 pandemic spread havoc, increasing human suffering, destabilizing the global economy, 
          and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe. The importance of health and well-being and its more significant
          impact on the global machinery and day-to-day life of people became more obvious to everyone through these troubling times.
           <br>
           <br>
          Road accidents are responsible for 1.3 million deaths and 50 million injuries annually worldwide.
          Road crashes are also the leading killer of children and young people worldwide aged five to 29. 
           The Covid 19 pandemic killed about 6 million people in nearly two years. We were able to get some control 
           over the disease through diligent efforts of scientists and doctors to understand the condition better, and
            through this gained knowledge, we were able to defeat the pandemic. The exact needs to happen with global road safety. 
            The pain of the families losing their loved ones is excruciating, and we need to put in efforts to understand global road
             safety better to make sure everyone's loved ones return safely home from their respective journeys. 
          
                
          <p style="color:green";>   Also, we would like to mention that this project addresses Sustainable Development Goal 3, regarding "Good Health and Well-being,"
            <img   src="images/sdg3.png" width="40" height="40"> more specifically target 3.6: Reduce road injuries and deaths.  </p> 

          As things stand, they are set to cause a further estimated 13 million deaths and 500 million injuries during the next decade,
           according to the UN. Road accidents are entirely preventable, and our priority is to investigate causes so that preventive measures can 
           be implemented. There are also countless other disadvantages of car collisions (e.g., disrupting traffic flow, cost resources, waste fuel, 
           and loss of life). Other than homicides, the incident of accidents that have the most contact with the public is fatal traffic collisions. 
           So there is enormous potential in building a traffic safety model that can help detect reasons for crashes early and help implement systemic 
           measures to prevent these unfortunate events.

          This website aims to empower you to investigate the Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City, for instance, when, where, and the factors contributing to the accident, to gain more education and knowladege on minimizing the number of accidents and eventually the number of died people.

            <h3>The goal of analyzing the data of Motor Vehicle Collisions</h3>
            <p>
            Given this interactive website, we want to cast light on several questions about Motor Vehicle Collisions in NewYork city  :
            <ol>
              <li>Provide a detailed 
                overview of how the data is distributed along different time perspectives. </li>
              <li>Investigate the change of distribution over the years, 
                especially contrasting it with Covid-19 year(2020)</li>
              <li>Show and predict the accidents, 
                their number, how many people die, where does the next accident happen and 
                the most relevant causes for the accident.</li>
              <li>Give an understanding of how the weather impacts these patterns, as a interesting perspective on the subject.</li>
